# Prosthetic Hand Control Module
- All content within this folder is the same content used for controlling 
arm
- All files were easily transferred using `scp` from host computer's 
command line

### Folders
1. lib
    - Supporting library with custom modules written for scripts found in 
    `samples` directory.
    - Currently, most scripts from previous team are included in lib and 
    some have been slightly modified. After scraping through code it seems 
    that not all scripts left are needed but they have been left as to not 
    break anything for future team.
2. samples
    - Contains scripts for controlling arm
